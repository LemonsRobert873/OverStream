Create a two-page streaming website named Overtime. The first page, index.html, will display a list of live and upcoming sports matches. The second page, player.html, will play the selected match stream.

Data Source:
Use this URL to fetch all match data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jitendra-unatti/fancode/refs/heads/main/data/fancode.json

Page 1: index.html - Match Listing

Layout & Style:

Header: Create a main title "Overtime" and a subtitle, for example: "Where the game never ends."

Structure:

A "Spotlight" section at the top to feature the first available live match.

A main grid section titled "Live & Upcoming" to display all other matches.

Styling: Use a dark, modern theme. Style the match cards to be clean and visually appealing. Add a loading animation (e.g., pulsing placeholder cards) that appears while data is being fetched. Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.

Functionality:

Fetch Data: On page load, asynchronously fetch the JSON data from the provided URL.

Process Data:

Sort the matches so that "LIVE" matches always appear before upcoming ones.

If there is at least one live match, display the first one in the "Spotlight" section.

Display all remaining matches in the main grid.

Render Match Cards:

Each match card should display the match image, tournament name, and title.

If a match is live, show a prominent "LIVE" badge on its card.

For each available stream URL in the match data, generate a button (e.g., "STREAM 1", "STREAM 2").

These buttons must link to player.html. The link must pass the match_id and the stream key (e.g., cdn, adfree_stream) as URL query parameters. For example: player.html?id=MATCH_ID&cdn=STREAM_KEY.

Page 2: player.html - Video Player

Layout & Style:

Page Title: The browser tab title should be "Overtime Player" or similar.

Structure:

A header section to display the current match title.

A main section containing a full-width video player that takes up most of the screen.

A simple footer with a "Go Back" button that links to index.html.

Styling: Maintain the dark theme. Use Tailwind CSS and the Plyr library for a clean, modern player interface.

Functionality:

Get Parameters: On page load, read the id and cdn from the URL query parameters.

Fetch Data: Fetch the same JSON data again from the source URL.

Find Stream URL: Find the specific match using the id from the URL. From that match's data, find the stream URL that corresponds to the cdn key from the URL.

Initialize Player:

Use the Plyr.js library to create the video player.

If the stream URL ends with .m3u8, use HLS.js to handle the streaming playback.

The video should attempt to autoplay when the page loads.

Display Title: Show the full title of the match in the header section.

Error Handling: If the id or cdn is missing from the URL, or if a matching stream URL cannot be found, display a clear error message on the page with a "Go Back" button.
